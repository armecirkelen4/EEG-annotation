In this repo you will find the code used to work on two different datasets, namely the Turkish SPIS dataset and a dataset from Sjællands Universitetshospital we had access to during the project. Both are EEG signal datasets and we have trained 4 different machine learning models to classify Eyes-open vs Eyes-closed epochs in the data.

All models can be found in the "models" folder.
All dataloading/curating/visualization can be found in the "utils" folder.

If you have any questions feel free to contact us at s214657@dtu.dk or s211939@dtu.dk
