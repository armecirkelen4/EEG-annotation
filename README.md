# EEG-annotation Gustav Rørhauge s214657 DTU, Felix Thorn s211939 DTU.

In this repo you will find the code used to work on two different datasets, namely the Turkish SPIS dataset and a dataset from Sjællands Universitetshospital we had access to during the project. Both are EEG signal datasets where we have trained 4 different machine learning models to classify Eyes-open vs Eyes-closed epochs in the data.
The aim is to automate the annotation process to free up valuable resources in the clinic that would otherwise be spent doing it manually.

All models can be found in the "models" folder.
All dataloading/curating/visualization can be found in the "utils" folder.

If you have any questions feel free to contact us at s214657@dtu.dk or s211939@dtu.dk
